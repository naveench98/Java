--How Java works--
Java is platform independent which means it can execute in any OS(linux,Windows..)
Java code will run with the help of JVM(Java Virtual Machine)
=

--How it will run in JVM
Programmer---->Java code------->Compiler----------->Byte Code(Class file which will create while running Java file)--JVM
JVM will run with Main method only(public static void main(String args[])
in JVM there will be Class loader which loads the class- Excution engine which executes the main method- Garbage collector for memory management- runtime data areas
hold object and variables

JRE(Java Runtime Environment)
where JVM found in inside of JRE
External libraries were found in JVM itself
=

JDK(Java Development kit)
WHere JRE will be inside of JDK

WHile running JAVA code in your pc it requires JDK,JVM,JRE
